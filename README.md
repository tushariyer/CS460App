Let's edit some images!

 * NOTE: each button has a shortcut available. Use it to get to your actions quicker!
 * Hit `Alt + S` or go to the `Tools` tab and click on `Select` to activate the select tool
 	* Click and drag a selection of the image
 	* Go to the `Effects` tab and pick an effect!
 	* Marvel as math is performed and the selected area now represents the change.

Like all great photo editing applications, all tools and effects work by extention of a selected area, so make sure to select an area of the image and then apply an edit/tool/image effect to it.

We used C# to create this application! :+1:

```c#
public void Tabula(){
	Application.Run(); //Woohoo!
}
```
